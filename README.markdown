# Json Formatter

This extension provides Json encode formatting for fields. Two formats are provided: Json Encode and Json Encode Title to make capitalize the string as a title should be.

In order to use this extension for inputs instead of textareas, you can use the [text box field extension](https://github.com/symphonists/textboxfield)

## Installation & Updating

Although the update should address this, fields that used a previous version (< 1.10) may appear to have no formatter specified and will need to be set manually.

Information about [installing and updating extensions](http://getsymphony.com/learn/tasks/view/install-an-extension/) can be found in the Symphony documentation at <http://getsymphony.com/learn/>.
